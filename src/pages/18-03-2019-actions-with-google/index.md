title: "Google actions in Actions"
---

This week I set out to great a app to keep track of different life stats using Google Actions. This would be the first time I am working with the Google Actions SDK which is both exciting and nerve racking!

## The Goal

The goal is simple, create a small set of actions that will increase simple stats of my day to day life. For example; Hey Google, add **1** to **coffee**.
