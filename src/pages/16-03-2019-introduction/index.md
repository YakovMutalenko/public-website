## Hello everyone!

Welcome to **#myweekinjs**. At this point, you may have a few questions right? Well, let me take some time to try and answer these questions.

1. What is **#myweekinjs**?
2. Do we need another developer blog?
3. Who is writing this?
4. Probably a lot more...

## 1. What is #myweekinjs?

This is a personal blog which will highlight what I did during a given week using JavaScript. It really is that simple! Most of these articles will be very short (hopefully) and will link to a [Github](https://github.com/myweekinjs) repo with the code for you to explore. I will also try to explain some of the more interesting approaches that I took during the development and the challenges I faced.

Hopefully, the once a week article and short nature of the articles will entice you to come back each week for a quick dose of JavaScript goodness!

## Do we need another developer blog?

Probably not, BUT, this is not only a developer blog. This website is an opportunity for me to experiment and grow as a developer. If by the end of the year I only have about 10 website views I'd still be happily posting each week about another exciting thing that I have learnt. This website is also an opportunity to become more involved with the developer community by contributing to open source projects and possibly writing a few of my own. Stay tuned!

## Who is writing this?

I go by many names, Adriaan, Adrian, AJ, theQuirkyTurtle, Adro codes and possibly a few more depending on who you ask. I am a Developer in Australia working on some government websites, as well as helping out local businesses with their website needs. I am also an aspiring Full Stack JavaScript developer, and this platform is another step towards that goal!

## Probably a lot more...

Now, onto some of my upcoming plans. Here are three projects that I intend to work on in the coming weeks and writing about to keep you guys coming back for more!

### 1. Twitter feed

The website is called **#myweekinjs** for a reason. I want to start making this a somewhat used hashtag on Twitter with people sharing what they learnt in JavaScript throughout the week. I want to develop a feed that will display on the website with the latest posts with this hashtag. It'll be a nice opportunity to play around with the Twitter API and possibly work some WebSockets into the mix.

### 2. Google Home Stats

I bought a Google home which is currently doing nothing. I want to create some actions which will count up certain stats on the website, for example the number of coffees I've had or the number of times I've been on StackOverflow etc etc This'll be a fun project to get some use out of the Google Home, plus pave the way for some more complex interactions down the road.

### 3. Intersection Observer Plugin

This could already exist but we'll see. This'll essentially be a plugin which will add classes to the body based on your position on the page. I want it to have a very simple API.

```javascript
import IOP from 'iop'

IOP.init({...})
```
```html
<div data-iop="something" />
```

Once you get to a div with the attribute `data-iop` the `something` class will be added to the body. From here it will be up to you to figure out what you want to do with that class name. It should be pretty neat!

## That is a wrap

That's all folks! Thank you if you made it this far! I am pretty excited about the upcoming weeks and expanding on the website and getting back to creating random stuff because I can. Feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hurricane_int), I want to become a lot more active on the platform and would love to start interacting with everyone!
