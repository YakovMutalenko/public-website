Personal blog of a Web Developer with a passion for writing pointless apps in JavaScript. This is what he played with this week.

```javascript
const object = {
  something: 'else',
  another: 'thing'
}

const { something, another } = object

console.log(something) // else
console.log(another) // thing
```
